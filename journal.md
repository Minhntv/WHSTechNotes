It is very important to follow instructions exactly as they are given while learning to code. Coding is and can be very delicate with one small mistake can cause your whole code to malfunction and go wrong. Precision is the most important thing when it comes to coding, a small error will lead to a big problem. If you happen to skip or miss steps or details when writing your code, it'll cause the code to do something you didn't intend for it to do or won't even work at all. It is important develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey so you don't keep making mistakes that will cause you hours of your time to fix and debug your code.

Computer science is basically behind everything technology related in this day and age and alot of people are dependent on it, without computer scienece modern day everyday life would be much harder and not so easy and not as convient as it is today. I would have to use a regular alarm clock that might malfunction if computer science didn't exist.

Just as much bebefits as Artificial intelligence (AI) may have, they also have many risks. Bias and discrimination, AI algorithms can be influenced by the data they are trained on, which can lead to bias and discrimination. Lack of transparency, as AI becomes more complex, it can be difficult to understand how decisions are made, which can make it harder to identify and fix errors. Job loss, AI can replace humans in many roles, especially those that involve routine tasks or simple decision-making. This can lead to unemployment, particularly for low-skilled workers. Data privacy and security breaches, AI systems rely on large amounts of data that often contain sensitive information, which can be vulnerable to privacy and security breaches.
