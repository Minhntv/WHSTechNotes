It is very important to follow instructions exactly as they are given while learning to code. Coding is and can be very delicate with one small mistake can cause your whole code to malfunction and go wrong. Precision is the most important thing when it comes to coding, a small error will lead to a big problem. If you happen to skip or miss steps or details when writing your code, it'll cause the code to do something you didn't intend for it to do or won't even work at all. It is important develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey so you don't keep making mistakes that will cause you hours of your time to fix and debug your code.
