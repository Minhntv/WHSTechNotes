It is very important to follow instructions exactly as they are given while learning to code. Coding is and can be very delicate with one small mistake can cause your whole code to malfunction and go wrong. Precision is the most important thing when it comes to coding, a small error will lead to a big problem. If you happen to skip or miss steps or details when writing your code, it'll cause the code to do something you didn't intend for it to do or won't even work at all. It is important develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey so you don't keep making mistakes that will cause you hours of your time to fix and debug your code.

One task or process that computer science plays a role in my everyday life is everymorning when I wake up. I use an alarm to wake me up everyday and computer science is used to work the alarm. Computer science is basically behind everything technology related in this day and age and alot of people are dependent on it, without computer scienece modern day everyday life would be much harder and not so easy and not as convient as it is today. I would have to use a regular alarm clock that might malfunction if computer science didn't exist.

Coding can improve probelm solving skills because coding helps you be more detailed oriented and pay attention to everything more. This can help you find the problem and figure out a solution quicker and more effiently. Understanding code can help you in industries that arenâ€™t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education by enhancing your problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity skills, which are applicable in diverse those fields. Coding enhances creativity and collaboration by encouraging problem-solving, supporting personal and collaborative projects, enabling experimentation, and providing practical applications.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has many benefits it can just about do anything to imporve everyday life. AI can help you make life more effient and convient as well as help you experience things that you would've thought impossible. AI has help us advance so far and improved our productivey. With the assistance of AI anyone can basically do anything they like if they have the means to. Overall AI has help us technologically advance greatly and bettered our everyday life and ways of life.

Just as much bebefits as Artificial intelligence (AI) may have, they also have many risks. Bias and discrimination, AI algorithms can be influenced by the data they are trained on, which can lead to bias and discrimination. Lack of transparency, as AI becomes more complex, it can be difficult to understand how decisions are made, which can make it harder to identify and fix errors. Job loss, AI can replace humans in many roles, especially those that involve routine tasks or simple decision-making. This can lead to unemployment, particularly for low-skilled workers. Data privacy and security breaches, AI systems rely on large amounts of data that often contain sensitive information, which can be vulnerable to privacy and security breaches.

It is important to make sure to safe guard your infomation and idenity from the internet. When publishing online besure to protect persenal and sensitive infomation because if sensitive data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to fraud, identity theft, or similar harms. Steps you can take to ensure your infomation is safe on platforms like github is to use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), review privacy settings, avoid sharing sensitive information publicly, regularly monitor account activity, and implement a process for reviewing code changes before committing them to a repository. I have not shared any of anything of mine that is too perseonal to share online. You can balance being open and collaboration in online spaces while protecting your privacy by using dedicated platforms with robust privacy settings, clearly communicate your boundaries, share only necessary information, utilize pseudonyms when appropriate, encrypt sensitive data, and be mindful of what you post publicly

An event that interests me is the usage of AI or atrifical intellegnce in the workplace. The usage of AI can potentially replace workers and jobs. AI is used by replacing and automating repetitive tasks or assisting with routine decisions. People are now in fear of losing their jobs to AI but the of usage of AI in workplace will only grow, so we workers must also grow and develope more skills.

Since computer science has advance so far, it is now able to do the job and work of normal human workers. This is a growing problem in our economy but there is no real way to counteract this issue other then creating new and different jobs to manage or control the AI. Using the AI to benefit us rather than it harming us.

Technology has revolutionized the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food, making it more efficient and accessible. For instance, precision agriculture uses drones and sensors to monitor crops, optimize water usage, and improve yields, while automated warehouses streamline food distribution to reduce waste. Online grocery platforms and delivery apps make purchasing food more convenient, especially during the holiday season when demand spikes. These advancements help keep costs down by reducing inefficiencies, ensuring food is more affordable and accessible for consumers. However, reliance on technology also introduces vulnerabilities, such as cybersecurity risks, supply chain disruptions, and a dependence on energy-intensive systems, which could lead to higher costs or shortages if these systems fail.
