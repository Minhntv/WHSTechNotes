It is very important to follow instructions exactly as they are given while learning to code. Coding is and can be very delicate with one small mistake can cause your whole code to malfunction and go wrong. Precision is the most important thing when it comes to coding, a small error will lead to a big problem. If you happen to skip or miss steps or details when writing your code, it'll cause the code to do something you didn't intend for it to do or won't even work at all. It is important develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey so you don't keep making mistakes that will cause you hours of your time to fix and debug your code.

One task or process that computer science plays a role in my everyday life is everymorning when I wake up. I use an alarm to wake me up everyday and computer science is used to work the alarm. Computer science is basically behind everything technology related in this day and age and alot of people are dependent on it, without computer scienece modern day everyday life would be much harder and not so easy and not as convient as it is today. I would have to use a regular alarm clock that might malfunction if computer science didn't exist.
